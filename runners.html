    <h1>Entry Process</h1>

    <p>Incredible, you have discovered the secret entry process to the Lambert &lt10k. Simply Venmo $4.20 to race director Brian Robbins. This is non refundable under any circumstance. Payment will automatically put you into the race lottery. Once you are in the lottery your name will be automatically drawn. Congratulations, you just paid to run on public trails that we donâ€™t even have permission to have an organized race on. The Lambert &lt10k reserves the right to call the names of athletes who have not registered for the race or who have not made plans to compete. If this happens to you, please come up with the $4.20 and be to the start line promptly. The entirety of the entry fees get split in half and awarded to the winner of the male and female division respectively. 
    As usual the race will take place on December 31, 2021. Start time is 8:00 am. 
    See you in Lambert!</p>

    <h2 id="pacers">Pacers</h2>

    <p>If you would like to use pacers, you are welcome to do so. However, they will be required to pay a prorated entry fee, based on the percentage of the course they run. They will accordingly be eligible only to that percentage of the winnings, given their runner is the winner. Unless their runner decides not to split the winnings with them.</p>
