    <h1>Lambert &lt10k</h1>
    <p class="intro">The most storied, odd mileage, relatively young, competitive single track trail foot racing contest, of all time. 
      Every year on the eve of the next year, hundreds if not dozens of the world’s most competitive adults (and a handful of children) gather on the hallowed grounds of Lambert Park in Alpine, Utah. They are there for one purpose: to measure who has the biggest….. heart and drive of all their “friends”. </p>

      <p>Unlike other 5.96 mile runs, the Lambert &lt10k is not for having fun. It’s not for catching up with all of your buddies. It’s for peacocking and running at an unsustainable, slobbering pace to the point of near cardiac arrest so you will not lose to that one guy or gal. There is no talking. It’s critical. </p>

      <p>In the end, only one adult will walk away with the &lt10k World Championship belt. If that is you, prepare for the fast paced life of sponsorship and minor celebrity status throughout northern Utah County. Consolation prizes are given to the first and second losers of two of the genders, plus cash prizes. </p>

      <p>Since the genesis of the race, the directors felt that course should be experienced in each and every way. To make this happen a move was made, the likes of which has never been done. In even years the loop is run clockwise, while in odd years the course switches directions and is run counter clockwise. Just one of the many innovative aspects that makes Lambert unlike any other competition.</p>

      <p>Racers will sprint through the majestic preserves that create a priceless oasis amid the mansions of Utah’s finest personal injury attorneys and multi level marketers. Climbing and turning and descending through legendary trails such as, High Bench, Spring, Middle Spring and Spring. There are also other trails for which to run on. </p>

      <p>Entry process: simply Venmo $4.20 to race director Brian Robbins. This is non refundable under any circumstance. Payment will automatically put you into the race lottery. Once you are in the lottery your name will be automatically drawn. Congratulations, you just paid to run on public trails that we don’t even have permission to have an organized race on. The Lambert &lt10k reserves the right to call the names of athletes who have not registered for the race or who have not made plans to compete. If this happens to you, please come up with the $4.20 and be to the start line promptly. The entirety of the entry fees get split in half and awarded to the winner of the male and female division respectively. 
      As usual the race will take place on December 31, 2021. Start time is 8:00 am. 
      See you in Lambert!</p>
