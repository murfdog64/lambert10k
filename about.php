    <h1>The Race</h1>

    <p>Since the genesis of the race, the directors felt that course should be experienced in each and every way. To make this happen a move was made, the likes of which has never been done. In even years the loop is run clockwise, while in odd years the course switches directions and is run counter clockwise. Just one of the many innovative aspects that makes Lambert unlike any other competition.</p>

    <p>Racers will sprint through the majestic preserves that create a priceless oasis amid the mansions of Utahâ€™s finest personal injury attorneys and multi level marketers. Climbing and turning and descending through legendary trails such as, High Bench, Spring, Middle Spring and Spring. There are also other trails for which to run on. </p>
